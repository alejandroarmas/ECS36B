### Problem Statement 


In this assignment (HW4), you will implement a programcalled maydaythat printsa list of airports and runways that are closest to a given location. The program will list airports that have runways longer than a given minimum length. It will also print the distance from the given location to the airport. In a fictional scenario, a pilot who encounters an emergency situation would use your program to get a list of the nearest landing options. The pilot would enter his/her current location as latitude and longitude (in degrees decimal) as well as the minimum runway length needed to land (in ft).

This assignment will test your C++ proficiency in opening and reading text files, using strings, using STL containers, using STL algorithms, and implementing function objects.
